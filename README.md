## Project goals   

1. Learn how to map reads and extract expression data for individual cells.
2. Cluster cells according to their gene expression patterns.
3. Use marker genes to identify cell types and clusters.
4. Use statistical analyses to identify cells that are enriched in specific cell types.
5. Use trajectory analysis to determine the lineage connections of the cells.
